# TonUINO TNG 3.1 - Dutch files

These are the Dutch audio files for a Tonuino 3.1. I'm not quite sure on some things, mainly mp3/0320 + 0321, my German isn't very good. If someone is able to provide an accurate description, I will modify these.

I modified some prompts to sound better in Dutch in my opinion, but this is of course very subjective.

If you are interested in changing a few lines without special software, I used the following website and the Dutch/Lotte voice:
